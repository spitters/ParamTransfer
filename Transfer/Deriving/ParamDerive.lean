# Toward a `@[derive Param]` handler (two more mechanized
inductives + the deriving-handler design)

`ParamData.lean` hand-ported the relational lift for the three representative
inductive shapes Trocq's Elpi generates one file per: binary product, optional,
recursive list. This file does two things.

1. Mechanizes two more inductives by hand, in the exact `ParamData` style —
   the binary sum `R_sum`/`paramSum` (Coq `generic/Param_sum.v`), the
   representative *multi-constructor non-recursive* shape, and the parameter-free
   `Nat` `R_nat`/`paramNat` (Coq's natural-number relation), the
   representative *recursive, parameter-free* shape whose relation collapses to
   equality and whose recursor supports the full `map3`.

2. Specifies the deriving-handler algorithm (the design note below), the
   procedure a `DerivingHandler` would run to emit these files
   automatically — what Trocq's Elpi does in Coq.

Implemented: the two hand-ported inductives (fully proved,
`#print axioms`-clean) plus the design note. The full `DerivingHandler`
elaborator is specified, not implemented.

## Design note — the `@[derive Param]` handler algorithm

Given an `InductiveVal` for a simple inductive `F` with type parameters
`(α₁ … α_k : Type)` (no dependent indices), the handler should:

1. Read the parameters. Take `k` element relations
   `Pᵢ : Param mᵢ nᵢ αᵢ αᵢ'`. The output is `Param ? ? (F α₁ … α_k) (F α₁' … α_k')`.
2. Build the relation `R_F`. For each constructor
   `cⱼ : Πfields. F α…`, emit one clause relating `cⱼ x… ~ cⱼ y…` by the
   *pointwise* lift of the field relations: a field of type `αᵢ` uses `Pᵢ.R`; a
   field of recursive type `F α…` uses `R_F` (the recursive call); a field of a
   previously-derived type `G β…` uses `R_G (…)`. Distinct constructors are
   `False`-related. (This is exactly `prodR`/`optionR`/`listR`/`R_sum` above.)
   Mechanically: `inductive R_F … : F α… → F α'… → Prop` with one constructor
   per `cⱼ`, taking the field-relatedness hypotheses — a `Forall₂`-style
   congruence.
3. Synthesize the forward `map` from the recursor. `F.rec` with motive
   `fun _ => F α'…`, each minor premise applying `cⱼ'` to the
   field-images (`Pᵢ.fwd.map` on element fields, the recursive `map` on
   recursive fields). This is `F.map`/`Sum.map`/`Nat.rec` specialized.
4. `map_in_R` (→ `map2a`) by the recursor / induction. Induct on the source
   value (or `subst` the map equation); for each constructor discharge the
   field-relatednesses from the element `Pᵢ.fwd.map_in_R` and the recursive IH.
   Needs each `Pᵢ` forward-`map2a`.
5. `R_in_map` (→ `map2b`, hence `map3`) by induction on the relation. Induct
   on the `R_F` derivation; each constructor case rewrites by the field
   `Pᵢ.fwd.R_in_map` and the recursive IH. Needs each `Pᵢ` forward-`map2b`.
   Funext-free: inductive fields are data, not function space, so unlike the
   arrow rule no `Funext` gate appears (Lean has `funext` as a theorem anyway).
6. Register. Emit `paramF : Param mapk … (F α…) (F α'…)` and add it to the
   `@[param]` database (`ParamDB.lean`).

Class cap. A non-dependent inductive reaches the same level as its weakest
field input — `map0`–`map3` univalence-free (the `Map4` coherence `R_in_mapK`
is the only residual, as everywhere in the port). A dependent index (an
inductive family `F : I → Type` whose constructors constrain the index, e.g. a
length-indexed `Vector`) caps the derivable class: the index equality must be
transported, and recovering the round-trip coherence there is where the
`map3 → map4` jump needs univalence — precisely the paper's `map0–map2a`
ceiling for the *universe*-touching cases. The handler should detect a
non-trivial index and refuse above `map2a` (or require the user to supply the
coherence).

## Bigger picture — reuse Mathlib's `Translate` framework

Mathlib refactored `to_additive` into a generic term-translation framework
`Mathlib.Tactic.Translate` (`Core.lean`, ~1229 LOC). It is structurally this
engine's `@[param]` + `#transfer` translator but far more mature, and this
engine's `#transfer`/`@[param]` should be re-expressed on top of it rather than
reinvented:

* Its DB is a `NameMapAttribute` (`Batteries.Lean.NameMapAttribute`,
  `Core.lean:16`) mapping `src ↦ TranslationInfo` (`:188`) — exactly this
  engine's `paramExt : NameMap (Name × Name)`, but with `reorder`/`relevantArg`
  metadata. The `paramExt` should become a `NameMapExtension` of a
  `Param`-witness record.
* `applyReplacementFun` (`:440`) is a generic structural term rewriter
  parameterised by the DB; `transformDeclRec` (`:742`) walks a declaration and
  its companions. This engine's `translate` is the same walk — `applyReplacementFun`
  should be *parameterised with the `Param`-witness relation* instead of the
  additive name map (i.e. carry the relatedness proof alongside the replaced
  constant, the one thing `to_additive` does not need).
* `proceedFields` (`:983`) already handles structure projections and
  `isInductive` (`:1198`) special-cases inductive declarations — the exact
  machinery the deriving-handler step (3)–(5) re-implements by hand. Reusing it
  gives projection/inductive translation for free.
* `GuessName.lean` auto-derives the target name from the source; this engine's
  translator demands an explicit `c'`, so `GuessName` would let `@[param]` infer
  the transferred constant's name.

The reuse is: instantiate `Translate`'s `TranslateData`/`Config` with a
`Param`-witness payload, replacing the additive-name substitution with the
relatedness-carrying substitution, and let its `transformDeclRec`/`proceedFields`
do the structural+inductive+projection walk that `ParamTranslate` does by hand.

The representative *recursive, parameter-free* inductive. With no type
parameter the pointwise lift collapses to equality (`zero ~ zero`,
`succ n ~ succ n'` iff `n ~ n'`, i.e. `n = n'`), and the recursor supports the
*full* `map3` in both directions (the identity map's graph is `Eq`, both
inclusions identities) — univalence-free. This is the base case the handler hits
for any closed (parameter-free) inductive: the derived relation is `Eq` and the
`Param` is the diagonal at `map3`. -/
