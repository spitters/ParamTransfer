# An effectful transfer across a value-type change, proved by `mvcgen`

A self-contained companion to `Examples/HexEffectful.lean`. Where that example
transfers a triple across a *storage* change at the same value type (`ℤ`, related
by equality), this one changes the value *type*: a `do`-block over `ℕ` transfers to
the same computation over `ℤ`, related by the cast `Rα a a' := ((a : ℤ) = a')`.

The recipe is the one the library runs everywhere, here at the monad level:

1. write the concrete program and prove its triple with `mvcgen` (`natProg_spec`);
2. build the Kleisli witness `RComp Rα` relating the two programs, assembled
   from `RComp.pure` / `RComp.bind` and mirroring the `do`-block
   (`natIntProg_RComp`);
3. move the triple to the other representation with `triple_transfer`, deriving
   the target spec instead of re-proving it (`intProg_spec`).

The witness is assembled by hand from the `pure` / `bind` rules — the discipline a
`param`-style tactic would automate. The effectful-loop / early-exit case (a `for`
loop rather than straight-line `bind`s) is `RComp.forIn_list` in
`Integrations/ParamForIn.lean`.

  let b ← pure (m + 1)
  pure (a + b)

/-! ## Step 2 — the `RComp` witness across the cast relation

Assembled leaf-by-leaf from `RComp.pure` / `RComp.bind`, mirroring the `do`-block:
each `pure` read is related by the cast on that value, and the final combination
by the cast being additive. -/

/-- The two programs are `RComp`-related at the cast relation
    `Rα a a' := ((a : ℤ) = a')`: reading `n + 1` on the left decodes to `↑n + 1` on
    the right, likewise `m + 1`, and their sums agree under the cast. -/
theorem natIntProg_RComp (n m : Nat) :
    RComp (M := Id) (fun (a : Nat) (a' : Int) => (a : Int) = a')
      (natProg n m) (intProg (n : Int) (m : Int)) :=
  RComp.bind (RComp.pure _ (by push_cast; ring))
    (fun a a' (ha : (a : Int) = a') =>
      RComp.bind (RComp.pure _ (by push_cast; ring))
        (fun b b' (hb : (b : Int) = b') =>
          RComp.pure _ (by
            show ((a + b : Nat) : Int) = a' + b'
            rw [← ha, ← hb]; push_cast; ring)))

/-! ## Step 3 — the transferred triple, derived not re-proved

`triple_transfer` carries `natProg_spec` across the witness. The postcondition
relatedness turns the `ℕ` postcondition `r = (n+1)+(m+1)` into the `ℤ` one along
the cast; nothing about `intProg` is re-verified. -/

/-- The `ℤ` program's triple, obtained from the `ℕ` one by transfer. -/
