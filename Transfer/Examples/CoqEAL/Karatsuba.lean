# CoqEAL Karatsuba polynomial multiplication, ported to Lean

CoqEAL's `karatsuba` is the headline algorithm refinement of the library: a fast
polynomial multiply proven to refine the schoolbook product. This file ports the
algebraic core of that refinement onto CompPoly's computable `CPolynomial R`, and
registers it in the engine's `@[transfer]` registry (`Transfer.Base.Core`).

## What is proved

The Karatsuba trick rewrites a single split product

```
  (lo + Xᵏ·hi) · (lo' + Xᵏ·hi')
    = z₀ + Xᵏ·z₁ + X²ᵏ·z₂
```

with `z₀ = lo·lo'`, `z₂ = hi·hi'`, and `z₁ = (lo+hi)·(lo'+hi') − z₀ − z₂` — i.e.
three multiplications instead of four. `karatsubaMul` is exactly this
recombination on the four halves, and `karatsubaMul_eq` proves it equals the
product of the two reconstructed polynomials.

The proof transfers the goal across CompPoly's `RingEquiv`
`CPolynomial R ≃+* Polynomial R` (`CPolynomial.ringEquiv`, whose underlying map
`toPoly` is injective) to Mathlib's `Polynomial R`, where the recombination
identity is a commutative-ring fact discharged by `ring`. The transfer is sound
because `toPoly` is a ring homomorphism on `+`, `-`, `*`, `^` (CompPoly's
`toPoly_add` / `toPoly_sub` / `toPoly_mul` / `toPoly_pow`), so no coefficient
reasoning is duplicated and canonicalization (trailing-zero trimming) is handled
inside those CompPoly lemmas.

## Scope

This is the **one-level** Karatsuba step, taking the four halves as explicit
arguments. A full `karatsubaMul' : CPolynomial R → CPolynomial R → CPolynomial R`
would (a) split each input at a chosen degree `k` (a `divByMonic`/`modByMonic`
or array-`extract` operation on the canonical representation), (b) recurse on
the three half-products, and (c) terminate by a decreasing-degree measure with a
base case below a cutoff. The *splitting* and the *recursion/termination* (matching CoqEAL's
`Rmorph_karatsuba` over MathComp `{poly R}`) are not part of this file, which
proves the algebraic identity and `karatsubaMul = (· * ·)` for the structured
(already split) case. `KaratsubaRec` supplies the splitting and the fuel
recursion.

## Registry entry

`karatsuba_repr` is tagged `@[transfer]` in the *refine* direction (structured
product ↦ Karatsuba recombination), so `repr_transfer` automatically rewrites a
`CPolynomial` product presented in split form `(lo + Xᵏ·hi)·(lo' + Xᵏ·hi')` to
its three-multiplication Karatsuba form.

/-- **One-level Karatsuba recombination** on the four halves of a split product.

    Given the low/high halves `lo, hi` of `p = lo + Xᵏ·hi` and `lo', hi'` of
    `q = lo' + Xᵏ·hi'`, this computes the product `p · q` using only three
    half-multiplications (`z₀`, `z₂`, and the middle `(lo+hi)·(lo'+hi')`)
    instead of the four a naive cross product would use:

    `z₀ + Xᵏ·z₁ + X²ᵏ·z₂` with `z₁ = (lo+hi)·(lo'+hi') − z₀ − z₂`. -/

/-- **Correctness of the Karatsuba step.** The recombination equals the product
    of the two reconstructed polynomials `lo + Xᵏ·hi` and `lo' + Xᵏ·hi'`.

    Proved by transferring across the ring equivalence

    Karatsuba algebraic identity in full; the recursion/termination/splitting is
    the named residual (see the module docstring). -/

/-- **Registry entry (refinement direction).** Tagged `@[transfer]` so that
    `repr_transfer` rewrites a structured `CPolynomial` product
    `(lo + Xᵏ·hi)·(lo' + Xᵏ·hi')` to its Karatsuba three-multiplication form
    `karatsubaMul k lo hi lo' hi'`. This makes Karatsuba a registered refinement
    in the transfer engine, alongside the field-kernel and `SeqPoly`
    add refinements. -/
