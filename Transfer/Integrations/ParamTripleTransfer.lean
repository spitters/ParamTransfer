# Transferring a Hoare/`wp` triple through a `Param` relation

This module lifts the abstraction-theorem `∀`-rule (`ParamTransfer.forallTransfer`)
from *propositions* to *monadic computations*: it builds a **triple-transfer
principle**. Given a value-level `Param`-style relation between two computations
and a Hoare triple for the source, it derives the triple for the transferred
computation, using only the `wp_pure`/`wp_bind` algebra of `Std.Do.WPMonad`.

## The Kleisli-level logical relation `RComp`

`ParamForall`/`ParamTransfer` give the abstraction theorem at `R_arrow`/`R_forall`
— the *pure* function level. Talking about *effectful* programs requires the same
logical relation lifted to the Kleisli category of a monad `M`. `RComp Rα c c'`
is exactly that lift, phrased as **`wp`-refinement modulo the value relation**:

  `RComp Rα c c' := ∀ Q Q' E, (∀ a a', Rα a a' → Q a ⊢ₛ Q' a') →`
  `                  wp⟦c⟧ (Q, E) ⊢ₛ wp⟦c'⟧ (Q', E)`

i.e. any success-postcondition pair related pointwise by `Rα` (sharing the
failure barrel `E`) is refined from `c` to `c'` at the level of weakest
preconditions. This is the canonical Reynolds/Kleisli lift: the relation on
computations induced by the relation on values, read through the `wp`
observation.

The two `pure`/`bind` rules below are the compositional core — the
content of the abstraction theorem at the monad level:

* `RComp.pure` — `Rα a a'` gives `RComp Rα (pure a) (pure a')` (via `wp_pure`);
* `RComp.bind` — `RComp Rα c c'` and a pointwise `RComp Rβ (f a) (f' a')` give
  `RComp Rβ (c >>= f) (c' >>= f')` (via `wp_bind`).

`RComp.refl` records the diagonal instance (`Rα = Eq`, `c = c'`): every
computation is `wp`-refinement-related to itself, the `paramDiag` analogue.

## The triple-transfer lemma

`triple_transfer` follows: since `Triple x P Q` is *defined* as
`P ⊢ₛ wp⟦x⟧ Q`, an `RComp`-witness composes on the left with the source triple
to yield the transferred triple. The pure/bind closure means an `RComp`-witness
for a whole do-block can be assembled structurally from witnesses for its
leaves — exactly the abstraction-theorem discipline `ParamTransfer` runs for
`∀`-statements, here for stateful/partial `SPComp` programs.

## Worked examples

Two self-contained examples exercise the principle end-to-end over `Id`:

* `Examples/HexEffectful.lean` — a Bareiss-style elimination step: the source
  triple is proved by `mvcgen`, then `triple_transfer` moves it across a storage
  change (dense list ↦ Mathlib vector) at the same value type;
* `Examples/EffectfulTransfer.lean` — a `do`-block whose value *type* changes
  (`ℕ ↦ ℤ` along the cast relation), again `mvcgen` for the source and
  `triple_transfer` for the target.

`RComp.forIn_list` (`Integrations/ParamForIn.lean`) extends both to `for` / `do`
loops with early exit.

## Scope

Proved (univalence-free, `Prop`-predicate triples only):

* the Kleisli logical-relation lift `RComp` and its `pure`/`bind`/`refl` closure
  — the compositional core of the abstraction theorem at the monad level;
* `triple_transfer`, transferring `Triple c P (Q, E)` to `Triple c' P (Q', E)`
  along any `RComp`-witness;
* two worked `Id` examples (`HexEffectful`, `EffectfulTransfer`), each with an
  `mvcgen`-proved source triple transferred across a change of representation.

Not implemented here:

* `MetaM`-level synthesis of the `RComp`-witness for an arbitrary do-block (the
  `param`/`trocq`-tactic analogue): here the witness is assembled by hand from
  `RComp.pure`/`RComp.bind`;
* full `mvcgen` integration (generating `RComp`-witnesses from `@[spec]`
  lemmas);
* the quantitative / advantage route is explicitly out of scope: expectation
  transformers are monotone but not conjunctive, so they do not inhabit
  `PredTrans.conjunctiveRaw` (see `StdDoBridge`); quantitative transfer belongs
  to the `Advantage`/`sdist` layer, not to this `Prop`-predicate `wp` principle.

/-! ## The Kleisli-level logical relation `RComp`

The relation on computations induced by a value relation `Rα`, read through the
`wp` observation: a `wp`-refinement that holds for every `Rα`-related
postcondition pair (sharing the failure barrel). This is the monad-level analogue
of `R_arrow`/`R_forall` from `ParamForall`/`ParamTransfer`. -/

/-- **The Kleisli lift of a value relation.** `RComp Rα c c'` holds when, for
    every pair of success-postconditions related pointwise by `Rα` (sharing one
    failure barrel `E`), the weakest precondition of `c` entails that of `c'`.
    This is the canonical logical-relation lift of `Rα` to `M`-computations,
    observed via `wp`. -/
def RComp {M : Type u → Type v} {ps : PostShape.{u}} [WP M ps]
    {α α' : Type u} (Rα : α → α' → Prop) (c : M α) (c' : M α') : Prop :=
  ∀ (Q : α → Assertion ps) (Q' : α' → Assertion ps) (E : ExceptConds ps),
    (∀ a a', Rα a a' → Q a ⊢ₛ Q' a') →
    wp⟦c⟧ (Q, E) ⊢ₛ wp⟦c'⟧ (Q', E)

/-- **`pure` rule of the abstraction theorem at the monad level.** A value
    relatedness `Rα a a'` lifts to computation relatedness of the point
    distributions `pure a`, `pure a'`. Proved through `WPMonad.wp_pure`. -/

  intro Q Q' E hQ
  simp only [WPMonad.wp_pure, PredTrans.apply_Pure_pure]
  exact hQ a a' h

/-- **`bind` rule of the abstraction theorem at the monad level.** Sequencing
    two related computations with two pointwise-related continuations yields
    related computations. Proved through `WPMonad.wp_bind`: the bound `wp`
    factors as `wp⟦c⟧ (fun a => wp⟦f a⟧ ·)`, so the head refinement `RComp Rα c
    c'` applies with the per-result continuation refinements as its
    postcondition relatedness. -/

    (fun a a' h => hf a a' h Q Q' E hQ)

    `wp`-refinement-related to itself under the equality value relation. The
    monad-level counterpart of `ParamTransfer.paramDiag`. -/

/-! ## The triple-transfer principle

`Triple x P Q` is *defined* as `P ⊢ₛ wp⟦x⟧ Q` (`Std.Do.Triple`), so an
`RComp`-witness — a `wp`-refinement — composes on the left of a source triple to
give the transferred triple. -/

/-- **Triple transfer along an `RComp`-witness.** Given relatedness `RComp Rα c
    c'`, a postcondition relatedness `∀ a a', Rα a a' → Q a ⊢ₛ Q' a'`, and a
    source triple `⦃P⦄ c ⦃Q, E⦄`, derive the transferred triple `⦃P⦄ c' ⦃Q',
    E⦄` (same precondition, same failure barrel). This is the monad-level
    abstraction theorem: the conclusion is read off `Triple = (· ⊢ₛ wp⟦·⟧ ·)`
    by transitivity through the refinement. -/
theorem triple_transfer {M : Type u → Type v} {ps : PostShape.{u}} [WP M ps]
    {α α' : Type u} {Rα : α → α' → Prop} {c : M α} {c' : M α'}
    (hcc : RComp (ps := ps) Rα c c')

    (hQ : ∀ a a', Rα a a' → Q a ⊢ₛ Q' a')

/-! ## A worked `pure ≫= pure` assembly

A two-leaf do-block witness assembled from `RComp.pure` and `RComp.bind`,
